# RMTC Architecture: Modules & Subsystems

This document describes each of RMTC's major modules and subsystems, their purpose, key classes, and current implementation status. It is designed to complement the canonical architecture document at [docs/technical/notes.md](README.md) with a focus on file paths and real class signatures extracted from the codebase.

## System Module

**Purpose:** Foundational type registration, configuration, object/property base classes, and core utilities.

**Key Classes:**
- `Factory` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/__init__.py:967`) — Dynamic instantiation and registration of RMTC classes using fully qualified type names (e.g., `rmtc.core.model.TorchModel-1.0.0`). Loads module definitions from YAML files and maintains a whitelist of allowed types.
- `Config` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/__init__.py:637`) — Singleton configuration manager. Loads YAML config files to provide database credentials, store settings, log levels, and system modes (production/testing).
- `Object` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/objects.py`) — Base class for all RMTC entities. Provides property system with types (Bool, Integer, String, DateTime, URI, Type, Package, Enum, Object references). Supports property arrays, access tracking, and event broadcasting.
- `Property` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/objects.py:121`) — Type-safe property wrapper supporting single values or arrays. Tracks ownership (member/non-member), visibility, requirements, and provenance direction (IN/OUT).
- `URI` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/__init__.py:160`) — Fully qualified resource identifier with query parameter parsing and manipulation. Supports file URIs and arbitrary schemes.
- `Version` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/__init__.py:25`) — Semantic versioning wrapper with validation and compatibility checking.
- `Datetime` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/__init__.py:118`) — ISO UTC timestamp wrapper enforcing consistent formatting.
- `TypeName` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/__init__.py:903`) — Parsed representation of fully qualified type names (module.category.name-version).
- `Logger` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/__init__.py:533`) — Python logging wrapper with event broadcasting.
- `Broadcaster` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/__init__.py:602`) — Simple pub-sub event system for object lifecycle notifications.

**Maturity:** Implemented. Factory and Config systems are production-ready; property system is complete with comprehensive type support.

## Objects & Containers Module

**Purpose:** Generic base classes for property-aware objects and abstract data container structures.

**Key Classes:**
- `Object` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/objects.py`) — Abstract base for all trackable items in RMTC. Manages properties, UUID identification, property change notifications, and immutability semantics.
- `PropertyDirection` (enum) — Defines provenance flow: IN (sources), OUT (derivations), INOUT (both).
- `Container` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/containers.py:14`) — Abstract base for 2D table-like data structures (e.g., datasets with correlated rows).
- `Table` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/containers.py:14`) — Abstract interface for 2D tables with row/column iteration, used by Dataset types.
- `TableIterator` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/system/containers.py:86`) — Abstract iterator for table traversal; concrete implementations like `PaddedTableIterator` and `RowMajorIterator` handle different dataset layouts.

**Maturity:** Implemented. Core object and property system is mature; containers are lean abstractions sufficient for current dataset types.

## Track Module: Provenance & Storage

**Purpose:** Entity storage abstraction, provenance graph management, and query interface for the distributed artifact tracking database.

### Entity Base Class

**Key Classes:**
- `Entity` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/track/store.py:52`) — Abstract base for all storable entities. Provides lazy loading (fetch/sync), lifecycle states (created/updated/synced/deleted), timestamp tracking, and JIT (just-in-time) sync capability.
- `Store` (abstract, `src/python/lib/rmtc/track/store.py`) — Abstract storage backend interface. Concrete implementations include Neo4j, Apache AGE, and JSON file stores.
- `Connection` (abstract, `src/python/lib/rmtc/track/store.py`) — Abstract database connection interface.
- `Queries` (abstract, `src/python/lib/rmtc/track/store.py`) — Abstract query builder interface.

**Maturity:** Implemented. Core entity lifecycle is solid; store backends are pluggable.

### Cypher/AGE Store Backend

**Key Classes:**
- `CypherConnection` (`src/python/lib/rmtc/core/track/store/cypher/connection.py:37`) — Concrete Connection implementation for Cypher-based graph databases (Neo4j, Apache AGE). Handles entity persistence, relationship management, parameterized queries (to prevent SQL injection), and property serialization.
- `CypherQueries` — Query builder for Cypher syntax, supporting both Neo4j and Apache AGE dialects.
- `Neo4jDatabase` (`rmtc.core.track.store.cypher.neo4j.Neo4jDatabase` per `res/modules/rmtc_core.yaml:337`) — Concrete Store implementation for Neo4j.
- `AGEDatabase` (`rmtc.core.track.store.cypher.age.AGEDatabase` per `res/modules/rmtc_core.yaml:341`) — Concrete Store implementation for Apache AGE (PostgreSQL extension).

**Maturity:** Partial. Core Cypher queries are implemented; recent work (commits visible in git history) shows parameterized query refactoring to address injection vulnerabilities.

### Tracking Entities

**Key Classes (from `src/python/lib/rmtc/track/entities.py`):**
- `Asset` (`Asset`, line 1119) — Base artifact representing a concrete digital asset (image, model, dataset).

- `Run` (`Run`, line 306) — Entity representing a single training execution. Owned by Solutions; owns result Weights and Checkpoints.
- `Inference` (`Inference`, line 630) — Entity representing model inference execution and results. Links Model, Weights, and output Datasets.
- `Watermark` (`Watermark`, line 1084) — Entity for tracking data provenance markers.
- `Session` (`Session`, line 42) — Entity for DCC or tooling sessions that produce inferences.
- `Environment` (`Environment`, line 19) — Entity for package and environment specifications.

- Builders transform artifacts (Model + Weights → TorchScript → Nuke CAT) and publish variants.

**Maturity:** Partial. Filesystem asset management works; facility-specific builders and Open Asset IO integration incomplete.

## GUI Module

**Maturity:** Prototype. Provenance visualization and property editing are functional; training management tools are incomplete.

## Placeholder Modules

**Purpose:** Stubs for future expansion.

**Scheduler Module** (`src/python/lib/rmtc/ops/scheduling.py`) — Deferred job scheduling abstraction intended for shared use by train and infer subsystems.

**Environment Module** (`src/python/lib/rmtc/core/system/environment/packages.py`) — Package and environment management (e.g., UV virtual environments). Allows injection of environment managers for dependency resolution.

**Interface Module** (`src/python/lib/rmtc/core/system/interface/`) — REST Server & Client stub for bridging distributed Systems via network.

## Key Design Patterns

### Injection & Deferral
Classes accept injected dependencies (trainers, I/O implementations, asset managers, schedulers) rather than hard-coding them. The Factory resolves type names to concrete classes at runtime.

### Provenance Immutability
Artifacts are immutable; updates via variants or new artifacts only. Licenses form the terminus of provenance traces.

### Data Minimization
Entities are lazy-loaded (fetch retrieves light representation, sync loads full properties). JIT sync pulls partial entities on first access to non-required properties. Reverse relationships (Run → Solution, not Solution → Runs) prevent massive pulls.

### Type Registration
All storable classes registered in `res/modules/rmtc_core.yaml` with fully qualified type names. Factory whitelist prevents arbitrary code execution.
