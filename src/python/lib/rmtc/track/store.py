    This occurs if someone is accessing an entity property that is not yet pulled
    from the storage system - normally this would be invalid, however with ISync
    it is synced before accessing and the value is valid.

    HOWEVER - it is not batched, the connection is created and destroyed on access,
    it can be terribly inefficient and it is better to sync intentionally via entity
    batches. As a result it is advised to issue a warning if this is called.

    If a store does not provided a ISync delegate, then nothing happens.

    It simply is a last line of defence that creates a friendlier API.
