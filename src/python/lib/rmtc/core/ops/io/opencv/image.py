    Reader/writer for EXR image files with HDR support.

    The EXR class handles reading and writing of EXR (Extended Dynamic Range)
    image files using OpenCV. It automatically handles color space conversion
    between BGR (OpenCV default) and RGB formats, and ensures 4-channel RGBA
    output by adding an alpha channel when necessary.

    EXR files are commonly used in computer graphics and machine learning
    applications that require high dynamic range imaging with floating-point
    precision. The reader/writer uses half-precision floating-point format
    for efficient storage.
