    PyTorch model weights artifact for trained parameter storage.

    The TorchWeights class extends the base Weights to provide PyTorch-specific
    functionality for storing and loading trained model parameters. It handles
    PyTorch state dictionaries and integrates with the RMTC artifact system.

    This class is used to persist trained model parameters separately from
    the model architecture, enabling weight sharing across different model
    instances and training sessions.
